# Stock Prediction with Twitter Sentiment

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze Twitter sentiment for stock price predictions. The workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping live Twitter data using Tweepy.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning text data and using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
3. **Modeling**: Building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict stock price movement based on sentiment.
4. **Backtesting**: Evaluating the strategy using historical stock data.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, VADER, Matplotlib

### Key Results
- Achieved 75% accuracy in predicting price movement.
- Developed an automated system to update sentiment scores and predictions daily.
